# Overview

This repo includes the group work of the Big Data Analytics course project, where we try to: <br> <br>
* Answer a number of questions about a multi-category online store dataset. <br>
* Train a machine learning model to predict if a user will purchase a given added-to-cart product or not. <br>
* Visualize the results of the analysis.

For more info about the questions, you can check the proposal file.
